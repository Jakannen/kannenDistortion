- **Drive**: Controls the intensity of the distortion effect.
- **Range**: Adjusts the frequency range affected by the distortion.
- **Blend**: Balances between the distorted and clean signal.
- **Volume**: Controls the output volume.

## Requirements

To build and use the plugin, you need the following:

- **JUCE Framework**: Download from [juce.com](https://juce.com).
- **C++ Compiler**: Compatible with JUCE projects.
- **DAW (Digital Audio Workstation)**: For testing and using the plugin.

The plugin has been tested and works with FL Studio and other VST-supported hosts.
